> After the "extra" prompts I got sharing my experience with the app, the total available prompts got back to 25/month and max 5/day...

> let's enhance a bit the user experience on the "EntryForm"
> 
> - for "Location" field, pre-populate data to help data entry: after first 2 characters start propose data from ex.istent values within log entries table filtered by characters while typing.
> - Default to numeric pad for input when fillin' in numeric fields (especially when on small screens like mobile device)

> [!NOTE]
> this triggered an error while updating the code, it fixed the error autonomously

> Let's enhance the "All activities" filter: 
> 
> - date filter from/date to must stay in the same row when in small screen
> - add another select element to filter by record type (fill-ups/services/expenses)
> - After the change, on small screen the filter should show on separated rows:
> 	- Vehicle
> 	- Date From / Date To
> 	- Record type

> [!WARNING]
> this triggered another error, fixed by itself. BUT every spotted error counts as a new prompt, so after just 2 prompts I'm left with just another one for the day...
