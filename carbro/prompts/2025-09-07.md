> 
> - "Total stats" area: Total km, Average Fuel efficiency, max distance between fill-ups, average cost per fill-up, average price/liter.
> - Charts: 
> 	- line chart for fuel price over time.
> 	- pie chart of total expenses grouped by record type.
> 	
> remember to enable the "Reports" button on the main dashboard

> Please note that after any changes we've made during last two days you always found a "React hook dependency issue", please review all the code to avoid having this error every time the app is changed, as this is costing an additional prompt for each iteration.
