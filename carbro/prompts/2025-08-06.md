> A web app as a PWA, to keep track of fuel fill-ups and services on my cars. The app should manage the following data:
> 
> - Garage: to list and manage all my cars. Cars must have the following data: Brand, Model, Year, License Number, Notes.
> - Log: to list and manage all activities on the cars. These can be of 3 different type: fuel fill-ups, services and general expenses. Log must have the following data: car id, Odometer (in km), Total price (in euros), price per litre (in euros, only for fill-ups type), total litres (only for fill-ups), type of fill-ups (complete or partial, only for fill-ups), type of service/expense, service/gas station, notes. All numbers must be in decimal format up to 2 decimal places, no more. For complete fill-ups only, after inserting each record the app must calculate efficiency in Km/L of the last trip. Do not calculate if the fill-up is partial, then use the last complete fill-up to calculate the efficiency as soon as a new complete fill-up is added.
> 
> The app must have a top nav bar and a bottom bar. The top nav bar must have logo and title left aligned and the user profile menu (hamburger menu) on the right with "logout" menu item and selector for dark mode. The main container must have a first page that shows a selector of car at the top (as a first filter) then a mini dashboard for the selected car and right below all recent log entries (up to 10 entries). The mini dashboard must show: the average efficiency (Km/L), number of fill-ups, total expenses in fuel, total expenses in general. The recent log entries module have a "show all" at the bottom which opens the web view for all log. The bottom bar must have from left to right: garage button, "add" button, reports/chart button.
> 
> Tapping on the garage button opens the vew to manage cars data.Tapping on the "add" button shows first a selector for the type of record to be added (fill-up, service, expense) and once the user tap on the type of record, the app opens the web showing only relevant data field for the type of record as stated above. Report/chart button is a placeholder, it will be implemented in the future.
> 
> All web view that manage data must have the same top nav bar, relevant data, a bottom stacked button group with "save", "delete" and "back". Tapping on "save" saves data, tapping on "delete" deletes the current record, tapping on "back" goes back to the main container with mini dashboard. If there are pending data ingnore them.

> [!NOTE]
> It created the app but there was a bug at startup, it started looking into it and fixed autonomously.

> Good job, let's make some changes and fixes:
> 
> - App name is "CarBro"
> - User profile with hamburger menu is missing on the right of the navbar. Place the hamburger menu with items "dark theme selector" and "logout".
> - Fix colors: right now a light font color is applied on a light background. It's impossible to read. Use the right colors and contrast for the selected theme: if dark theme use light font color, if light theme use dark font color. The same applies to icons within buttons.
> - Within the bottom bar, add icons for "garage" and "Reports".
> - When in any page but dashboard, hide the bottom bar

---

> Very good, let's make some more changes.
> 
> For the EntryForm page:
> 
> - show the record date, with an editable date and time field. For new data, show current date.
> - Only for Fill-ups type, disable fields "Total litres" and "Price per litre" until "Total price" is valued. Once "Total price" data has been filled in, enable fields "Total litres" and "Price per litre" and automatically calculate "Total litres" if "Price per litre" is input first, vice-versa calculate "Price per litre" if "Total litres" is input first.
> 
> For the "All activities" page:
> 
> - Put the car selector on top, must open with the current selection from the dashboard but can be changed within the "All activities" page. Only for this page, add an "All cars" item to the selector to show all records for all cars.
> - Add a date filter with "date from" and "date to" to filter data within the selected time frame.

---

> let's fix a bug on EntryForm page:
> 
> - changing date is ignored when saving, it always overwrites with the current date. Please fix it to save with the date reported on the date field as user input.
> 
> Then let's make a small change in the visualization of glasscard for fill-ups in the "All Activities" page:
> - Do not show labels "complete" or "partial". For complete fill-ups, show a green badge on top right of fuel icon, show a yellow badge if it's partial instead. 
> 
> One important fix in terms of data protection: users must be able to see only data they inserted. Cars and log entries must be per user.

---

> some more fixes:
> 
> - the car selector must select last car (per year) by default
> - Add a new date/time field named "log_date" to the LogEntry entity and use this field as the date to be filled in within the EntryForm page. This is the date of the fill-up/service or expense. Please note this is not the timestamp of the saving, it is a separated date field that must replace the one within the EntryForm page.

> [!NOTE]
> Error with the new date field, option "fix by AI" available, used it and it worked.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Manually changed data security from app settings in "Security" with rule "only data inserted by user"

---

> - Keeping the car selector as is, change the order of listed car, they must be ordered per year descending.
> - After tapping on "add", selecting any type of record, the EntryLog must be inizialized with the car currenty selected in the dashboard.
> - For new entries "odometer" field must be inizialized with last odometer data, ignore record type, it must be the last odometer available for that car.
> - Let's make the calculation rule for fuel efficiency more precise. If partial fill-ups are present, they must be considered in the calculation of the fuel efficiency as follows: suppose you have a partial fill-up between two complete fill-ups, to calculate fuel efficiency you have to add all litres of the partial fill-ups until the last complete one, then use the difference in km between the two complete fill-ups to calculate efficiency.

---

> still something to be fixed for EntryForm, for new entries only:
> 
> - the record must be inizialized with the car currenty selected in the dashboard.
> - "odometer" field must be inizialized with last odometer data, ignore record type, it must be the last odometer available for that car.

---

> now let's implement all actions for the top nav bar hambuger menu:
> 
> - The "dark mode" toggle should change the theme settings from light mode to dark mode.
> - "Logout" simply logs out the user from the application

> [!NOTE]
> Did not work...

> sorry to say, but neither the dark mode toggle nor the logout buttons appear to be working. They simply do nothing on tap/click.

---

> still not working, clicking the "dark mode" toggle just changes text from "dark mode" to "light mode" and vice-versa but the app theme stays unchanged

> [!NOTE]
> Still not working and 2 more **precious** credits wasted... so I reverted back the app 2 step
